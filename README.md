Cucumber Framework Setup for Automation Testing
Project Overview
This project is a complete Cucumber framework setup designed for automation testing using Selenium WebDriver and the Java programming language. It follows a structured approach to ensure efficient test management and execution.
Technology Stack
Programming Language: Java


Framework: Cucumber


Build Tool: Maven


Automation Tool: Selenium WebDriver


Reporting Tool: Extent Reports


Project Structure
The project consists of the following key components:
Feature File:


Contains Gherkin language scenarios to describe test cases in a human-readable format.


Promotes Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) for better collaboration between stakeholders.


Step Definitions File:


Maps the feature file steps to corresponding Java methods.


Responsible for executing test actions using Selenium WebDriver commands.


Page Object Model (POM):


Implements the Page Object Model to maintain object repositories.


Enhances code reusability, maintainability, and readability.


Java Methods File:


Contains reusable methods for handling UI interactions and validations.


Runner File:


Serves as the execution trigger for test scenarios.


Configured using Cucumber’s @CucumberOptions for features, glue code, and reporting.


Reporting
Extent Reports is used to generate detailed and customizable HTML reports.


The reports include test case results, execution time, and screenshots for failed scenarios.


Conclusion
This project is a robust, scalable, and well-structured automation framework designed to streamline the testing process. With Cucumber’s BDD approach and the Page Object Model, it ensures better test coverage and maintainability.
